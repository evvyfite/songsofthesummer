            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>This was far more country than I expected it to be, and I really liked that about it! Although I usually like a breakup song, this one was not really doing it for me. It's a pretty good song, but with no particular attachment to either artist, I'm gonna leave it with a review of "eh, it's fine."</p>
