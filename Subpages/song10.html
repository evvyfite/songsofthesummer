            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>Like Sabrina Carpenter, Billie's new style is veering into that too-wispy style that I don't really love. I have a hard time hearing the lyrics of these, and I just kind of end up feeling bored. It's cute, but also overplayed on Tik Tok. I could see a few scenarios in which I would want to listen to this, but in most cases I would not turn to this immediately.</p>
