            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>This is a fantastically catchy song, and it does a really great job of recreating the pub song/irish drinking song vibe but in a more modern sense. This song in particular has been overplayed on Tik Tok so I couldn't really love it, but I'll admit it was fun to listen to. I'm not usually into "yeah buddy let's get hammered" songs, but once the hype around this one dies down I might honestly add it to one of my playlists.</p>
