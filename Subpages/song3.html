            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>Turns out I really don't like rap. It has a solid rhythm and I can tell it's a good song, but the only rap I like is Hamilton. I also have a hard tiime getting behind songs using the n-word -- even when the artist is Black and reclaiming its useage, I personally feel icky about it. I'm sure this is a great song for people who like rap, but it's just not for me.</p>
