            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>Like every other song in this list, Too Sweet has been overplayed the past few months, HOWEVER I could never say anything bad about a Hozier song. While I personally prefer Sunight and a few of his more underrated hits, the ones that go viral are still fantastic. Too Sweet is a beautiful, mellow song with fantastic vocals and awesome lyrics. Even the Tik Tok trend surrounding it was fun! This song is proof, once again, that no matter what I would die for Andrew Byrne-Hozier.</p>
