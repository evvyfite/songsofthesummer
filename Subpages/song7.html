            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>I like this song a little better than "Espresso." I still don't like her general singing style very much, but the lyrics of this song are very relatable, and she is a very talented lyricist and singer. It's a little jarring to hear her swear, but I honestly love that part, as a subversion of expectations is always fun. I still probably wouldn't listen to this on purpose, but I would enjoy hearing it play in Target.</p>
